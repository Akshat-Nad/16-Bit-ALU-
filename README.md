# 16-bit ALU ASIC Project

This project presents the **design and implementation of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**, carried out through the **complete ASIC design flow**, from RTL coding to final GDSII layout.

The ALU executes a set of **arithmetic and logical operations**, making it a fundamental building block for processors, microcontrollers, and digital systems. The project highlights practical **VLSI design methodologies**, emphasizing timing optimization, power efficiency, and physical layout considerations.

### Key Highlights
- RTL design implemented in **Verilog HDL**  
- Functional verification via **testbenches and waveform simulations** using Xcelium.
- Logic synthesized to a **gate-level netlist** using Cadence Genus. 
- **Place & Route (P&R)** completed with optimized placement and routing using Innovus. 
- Final **GDSII layout** generated, with DRC and LVS compliance checks. 

### Tools & Technologies
